{"name":"myProjects","tagline":"Some quick hacks for a day","body":"### Welcome to the webpage for \"myProjects\"\r\n\r\nI've gotten GitHub earlier this year, and while I learn some more features of it everyday,\r\nit's admittedly quite a piece of work.  On this page, you'll see some of my projects that I\r\nhave done over some time.  Balancing life as a student and developer is tedious, and I didn't\r\ninvest more time into my projects as I would have liked to.  These projects are some of the ones\r\nI quickly hacked in a day or two (parser took a little longer).\r\n\r\nThere were some third party libraries involved, especially for the Pagerank reinventing.  \r\n\r\nFor the Pagerank reinvention, you're going to have to download and activate a jsoup jar file \r\nas well as supply your own MYSQL database, username, and password in order to successfully run\r\nthe code.\r\n\r\nThe parser doesn't really need a third party library, but you need to write the code that the \r\nparser understands in a txt file.  An example would be:\r\n\r\n\r\n> var first\r\n\r\n> first = 1\r\n\r\n> var second\r\n\r\n> second = 1\r\n\r\n> print first\r\n\r\n> space\r\n\r\n> print second\r\n\r\n> space\r\n\r\nAnd the Image Gallery was a true hack (in one day), but it still misses some basic functionality\r\nlike logging out and some more attractive UI.  But the idea is there: image storage in the web.\r\nUnfortunately, this is not a live website yet, so you will need your own server as well as a \r\nMYSQL database.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

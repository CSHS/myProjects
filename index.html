<p>I've gotten GitHub earlier this year, and while I learn some more features of it everyday,
it's admittedly quite a piece of work.  On this page, you'll see some of my projects that I
have done over some time.  Balancing life as a student and developer is tedious, and I didn't
invest more time into my projects as I would have liked to.  These projects are some of the ones
I quickly hacked in a day or two (parser took a little longer).</p>

<p>There were some third party libraries involved, especially for the Pagerank reinventing.  </p>

<p>For the Pagerank reinvention, you're going to have to download and activate a jsoup jar file 
as well as supply your own MYSQL database, username, and password in order to successfully run
the code.</p>

<p>The parser doesn't really need a third party library, but you need to write the code that the 
parser understands in a txt file.  An example would be:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>var first</p>

<p>first = 1</p>

<p>var second</p>

<p>second = 1</p>

<p>print first</p>

<p>space</p>

<p>print second</p>

<p>space</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the Image Gallery was a true hack (in one day), but it still misses some basic functionality
like logging out and some more attractive UI.  But the idea is there: image storage in the web.
Unfortunately, this is not a live website yet, so you will need your own server as well as a 
MYSQL database.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

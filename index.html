<p>The code in the repository are samples of some of my work that I have done over the years.  My other work includes a collaborative whiteboard and chat web-app with support for rendering math texts, as well as a fundamental data visualization tool.  Live sites of these can be found <strong><a href="http://compilations.herokuapp.com">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>To reinvent <strong>Pagerank</strong>, there were a few third-party libraries involved.  You will have to download and activate a jsoup jar file as well as supply your own MySQL database in order to successfully run the code.  This project was made a little while back, so I am not too familiar with how I did this as I was then.  To give a broad rundown, a webcrawler gathers data throughout a user-specified site and stores them into the database. The data will then be manipulated by the Pagerank algorithm, and will produce a list of links on the site ranked in order of the algorithm. </p>

<p>The simple <strong>programming language written in Java</strong> was made out of a desire to help non-technical people learn to code by allowing them to write very natural words commonly used in English.  An example would be:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>var first</p>

<p>first = 1</p>

<p>var second</p>

<p>second = 1</p>

<p>print first</p>

<p>space</p>

<p>print second</p>

<p>space</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully, no one needs to explain in detail what this piece of code does.  The user should write this in a text file and run the Java program specifying the name of the file, and the variables 1 and 2 will then be printed on separate lines.</p>

<p><strong>Image Gallery</strong> was made in a short amount of time for fun and is not live, so you will need your own server (e.g. Apache) as well as a MySQL database.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit the site!</p>

<h4>ImageGalleryPHP</h4>  When viewing and testing the code, please use your local server.  This project was intended to exemplify a small portion of my abilities in web dev, particularly in the extensive use of Ajax. <br><p>Created in 2013</p>
  
<h4>imageGallery</h4> is the same concept as <strong>ImageGalleryPHP</strong>, but remastered with the Django framework using Python and SQLite3. <br><p>Created in 2013</p>
  
<h4>Java-written Programming Language</h4> I created a language I call GOKU, written in Java.  I was able to solve some Project Euler problems with it. <br><p>Created in 2014</p>

<h4>Pagerank</h4> After reading the thesis paper on PageRank, I reimplemented the algorithm in Java for the pure fun and challenge of it.  PageRank.java holds the actual algorithm.  Some external libraries used were:
   <ul>
      <li>mysql-connector-java using JDBC to connect to MYSQL database, and</li>
      <li>JSoup executable jar file to help parse data in Soup.java from a crawled site.</li>
   </ul>
   TJSearch.java is where one enters some key words, and the script will, after running Soup.java and PageRank.java, return a list of weblinks ranked in order of relevance by the algorithm.<br><br>
<br><p>Created in 2013</p>
  
Enjoy!

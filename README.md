myProjects
==========

<h4>ImageGalleryPHP</h4>:  Please note that I hacked this in less than a day, so there are some basic functionalities         missing: logging out (and destroying sessions), as well as some UI aesthetics, and most importantly, the registration.
   So when viewing and testing the code, please use your local server.  This project was intended to exemplify a small        portion of my abilities in web dev, particularly in the use of Ajax in linking the front    with the back-end.
  
  *"<h4>imageGallery</h4>" has the same concept as <strong>ImageGalleryPHP</strong>.  BUT, it is remastered in Django and has a UI alike Windows 8.
  
<h4>parser</h4>:  I created a parser called GOKU, written in Java.  I was able to solve some Project Euler problems with   it, which was pretty cool.
  
<h4>Pagerank</h4>:  I hacked and reimplemented the pagerank algorithm in Java for fun; nothing too serious.                PageRank.java stores the actual algorithm.  JSoup was an external file I used to parse data from the site I crawled.      TJSearch is where one can enter key words, and the script will return a list of links ranked in order of relevance by     the algorithm, with the mention of the keywords.

Note: For the latter two projects, there are not many invariants or annotations describing each part of the code; I apologize.  I hacked these at a quick rate a little more than 3 years ago, when good coding habits were not as strongly encouraged as they are now.  I will annotate them soon.
  
Enjoy!

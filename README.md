==========

<h4>ImageGalleryPHP</h4>:  Please note that I hacked this in less than a day, so there are some basic functionalities         missing: logging out (and destroying sessions), as well as some UI aesthetics, and most importantly, the registration.
   So when viewing and testing the code, please use your local server.  This project was intended to exemplify a small        portion of my abilities in web dev, particularly in the use of Ajax in communication between the client and the server.
  
  *"<h4>imageGallery</h4>" has the same concept as <strong>ImageGalleryPHP</strong>.  BUT, it is remastered in Django and has a UI alike Windows 8.
  
<h4>parser</h4>:  I created a parser called GOKU, written in Java.  I was able to solve some Project Euler problems with   it, which was pretty cool.
  
<h4>Pagerank</h4>:  After reading the thesis paper on PageRank, I reimplemented the algorithm in Java for fun; nothing too serious.  PageRank.java holds the actual algorithm.  Some external libraries I used were:
   <ul>
      <li>mysql-connector-java to connect to MYSQL database using Java, and</li>
      <li>JSoup executable jar file to help parse data in Soup.java from a website I crawled.</li>
   </ul>
   TJSearch.java is where one enters some key words, and the script will, after running Soup.java and PageRank.java, return a list of links ranked in order of relevance by the algorithm.<br><br>

Note: For the latter two projects, there are not many invariants or annotations describing each part of the code; I apologize.  I hacked these at a quick rate a little more than 3 years ago, when good coding habits were not as strongly encouraged as they are now.  I will annotate them soon.
  
Enjoy!

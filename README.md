myProjects
==========

Regarding ImageGallery:  Please note that I hacked this in one day, so there are some basic functionalities missing:
  logging out (and destroying session id), as well as some UI aesthetics, and most importantly, the registration.
  So to log in, the user must manually input his username and password into the MYSQL database.  But, the 
  fundamentals of what I wanted to get at with this project, for the most part, are all there.  
  
Regarding parser:  I created a parser called GOKU, written in Java.  I was able to solve some Euler problems which
  was pretty cool.
  
Regarding Pagerank:  I hacked and reimplemented the pagerank algorithm for fun; nothing too serious.  There is not
  a lot of annotation one can look at, and I apologize for that.  I will do that soon.
  
  Enjoy!
  
  *My projects are in "side" branch.  Thanks.

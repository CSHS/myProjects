==========

Regarding ImageGallery:  Please note that I hacked this in less than a day, so there are some basic functionalities         missing: logging out (and destroying sessions), as well as some UI aesthetics, and most importantly, the registration.
  So to register, the user must manually input his username and password into the MYSQL database.  This project was         intended to exemplify my abilities in web dev, particularly in the use Ajax in linking the front with the back-end.
  
Regarding parser:  I created a parser called GOKU, written in Java.  I was able to solve some Project Euler problems with it, which was pretty cool.
  
Regarding Pagerank:  I hacked and reimplemented the pagerank algorithm in Java for fun; nothing too serious.  There is not
  a lot of annotation one can look at, and I apologize for that.  I will do that soon.
  
Enjoy!
